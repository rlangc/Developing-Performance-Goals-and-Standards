# Developing Performance Goals and Standards

This job aid provides a structured approach to creating clear, measurable, and achievable performance goals and standards. It guides users through defining expectations, aligning goals with organizational objectives, and establishing criteria for measuring success. The aid is useful for managers, team leads, and employees looking to improve performance management and accountability.

  <tr>
    <td>1. Align with Organizational Goals</td>
    <td>Individual employee performance Goals “cascade” down from the top of the respective organization with a clear “line of sight” connecting the goals of the lowest established organization with the goals of higher-level organizations. Every employee’s individual goals and associated performance standards should be developed to align with and support successful achievement of their supervisor’s goals, and then, subsequently, USSS organizational goals.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2. Focus on Individual Results</td>
    <td>Define the desired outcome or deliverable that should result from accomplishment of the goal and then identify the critical action(s) necessary to successfully achieve the goal. As you accomplish this definition, you are beginning to establish the performance standards supporting accomplishment of the goal.

Outcome — an intended result or impact that supports the supervisor’s goal or the organizational goals, e.g.:
- Increase situational awareness
- Improve border security

Critical Action(s) — the key action(s) to be taken to achieve the desired outcome, e.g.:
- Maintain well trained workforce regarding security awareness skills
- Effectively manage port infrastructure including IT (e.g.: portals, computer systems)</td>

     <tr>
    <td>3. Include Measures and Targets</td>
    <td>Each goal and associated performance standard contains measures (what is to be done) and targets (how it is to be done, i.e., standards) that are achievable and realistic for the position’s span of authorized control.

Measures focus on what is to be accomplished and are a source of information used to track a desired outcome. There are generally two basic types of measures:

- Recurring — usually measured as rate, frequency, number, or percentage
- Project or one time — usually measured by time deadline, cost, and quality levels

Targets are the “score” or performance standards that describe when or how something is to be completed – by a certain date, in accordance with standard operating procedures, within budget. Standards are usually arrived at based on managers, supervisors, or organizational strategic objectives or targets; historical data (increases over past performance); customer requirements; or external standards set outside the organization, including public law or regulatory bodies.

Example: Reduce the number of service requests needing rework (measure) by 3% to 5% (target) for this performance cycle

Tip: Use ranges of targets when possible.</td>

     <tr>
    <td>4. Define Two Performance Standards: Achived Expectations and Achived Excellence</td>
    <td>USSS 4-level performance rating program requires that Goal Performance Standards must be formally written in the Work Plan at two levels — Acceptable (Level 3) and Outstanding (Level 5) - for each performance goal. Defining these two performance standards helps employees and Rating Officials determine and evaluate performance at the four different levels.

1. Unacceptable (Level 1): Employee performance was below the “Acceptable” standard (This level does not have to be written since it is determined by Level 3 i.e., if the employee work products do not meet the Level 3, then the employee efforts are below the “retention standard” and appropriate action is prescribed).
Acceptable(Level 3)     

    Performance standards written at this level should ensure supervisory and/or organizational goals and priorities are achieved. Employees who receive a rating of Acceptable at the end of the rating cycle will have substantively contributed to the achievement of their supervisor and/or organizational goal(s). For example:
- Increased the number of inspections by 8% during this performance cycle
- Assigned all available slots for Special Skills Training
- Updates and tests COOP as required by regulations and law
2. Exceeded Expectations (Level 4)

Employee performed at a level between the “Outstanding” and the

“Acceptable” standards (this level does not have to be written at the beginning of the appraisal period since it is established as a level between Level 3 and Level 5)

 

3. Outstanding(Level 5): At the “Outstanding” level, the written performance standards should reflect a significantly higher level of performance than at the level of “Achieved Expectations” – it should describe a contribution (result) that is well beyond what might ordinarily be expected or results in significant cost savings.

Other Examples:
- Increased the ratio of inspections to vehicles by 15% during this performance cycle
- In addition to the mandated table exercise, conducted additional exercise(s) with other internal/external offices/agencies for specific local issues during this performance cycle</td>
    <tr>
    <td>5. Ensure Balance</td>
    <td>Check goals and performance standards for balance among all the factors addressed, and consider, among other issues, matters such as:

  - The need for speed or increases in quantity while maintaining quality
  - The need for meeting project timelines with the need for cost effectiveness
  - The need for levels of approval with the need for meeting deadlines set externally
  - The need to maintain customer satisfaction while keeping costs down
  - The requirement to meet target dates in the face of reduced staffing</td>
  </tr>
</table> 

FINAL VALIDATION: The Goals and associated Standards must then be reviewed against the SMART criteria to ensure they are reasonable, fair, and easily understood.
