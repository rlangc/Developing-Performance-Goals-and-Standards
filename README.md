# Developing Performance Goals and Standards

This job aid provides a structured approach to creating clear, measurable, and achievable performance goals and standards. It guides users through defining expectations, aligning goals with organizational objectives, and establishing criteria for measuring success. The aid is useful for managers, team leads, and employees looking to improve performance management and accountability.

    <td>1. Align with Organizational Goals</td>
    <td>Individual employee performance Goals “cascade” down from the top of the respective organization with a clear “line of sight” connecting the goals of the lowest established organization with the goals of higher-level organizations. Every employee’s individual goals and associated performance standards should be developed to align with and support successful achievement of their supervisor’s goals, and then, subsequently, USSS organizational goals.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>2. Focus on Individual Results</td>
    <td>Define the desired outcome or deliverable that should result from accomplishment of the goal and then identify the critical action(s) necessary to successfully achieve the goal. As you accomplish this definition, you are beginning to establish the performance standards supporting accomplishment of the goal.

Outcome — an intended result or impact that supports the supervisor’s goal or the organizational goals, e.g.:
- Increase situational awareness
- Improve border security

Critical Action(s) — the key action(s) to be taken to achieve the desired outcome, e.g.:
- Maintain well trained workforce regarding security awareness skills
- Effectively manage port infrastructure including IT (e.g.: portals, computer systems)</td>

    <td>3. Include Measures and Targets</td>
    <td>Each goal and associated performance standard contains measures (what is to be done) and targets (how it is to be done, i.e., standards) that are achievable and realistic for the position’s span of authorized control.

Measures focus on what is to be accomplished and are a source of information used to track a desired outcome. There are generally two basic types of measures:

- Recurring — usually measured as rate, frequency, number, or percentage
- Project or one time — usually measured by time deadline, cost, and quality levels

Targets are the “score” or performance standards that describe when or how something is to be completed – by a certain date, in accordance with standard operating procedures, within budget. Standards are usually arrived at based on managers, supervisors, or organizational strategic objectives or targets; historical data (increases over past performance); customer requirements; or external standards set outside the organization, including public law or regulatory bodies.

Example: Reduce the number of service requests needing rework (measure) by 3% to 5% (target) for this performance cycle

Tip: Use ranges of targets when possible.</td>

    <td>4. Define Two Performance Standards: Achieved Expectation</td>
    <td>USSS 4-level performance rating program requires that Goal Performance Standards must be formally written in the Work Plan at two levels — Acceptable (Level 3) and Outstanding (Level 5) - for each performance goal. Defining these two performance standards helps employees and Rating Officials determine and evaluate performance at the four different levels.</td>
